Please implement Debit Card Screen and Set weekly spending limit screen.

You can define your own user stories (business requirements) with those designs. Those requirements should be described in README.md. Pls send us back your works via GitHub or GitLab.

Notes:
> Make the calls to a mock API server to return dummy data. We will not evaluate your server code so you can choose your own way to implement the server side.
> Unit Test is an optional but it is a very positive point.
> README.md file also shows your coding skills and experience.
> Typescript and Redux Saga are optional but recommended just because we are using them. Make sure your app can run on both iOS and Android
```

## Business requirements

User could access their Debit Card information by switch to the Debit Card tab in Bottom Tab UI

The Debit Card screen should masked user's card information by default. Masked card should replace the first 12 numbers of the `Primary Account Number` and `Card Security Code` with asterisk character.

From Debit Card screen, user could turn off masked mode to view the card details

From Debit Card screen, user could start set up the **Weekly spending limit** by tapping on the row with the same label. The app should navigate to Spending Limit screen afterward.

From Spending Limit screen, user could either enter the amount manually or select from one of the pre-defined options. Once the amount has been filled, user then could submit it and get navigate back to Debit Card screen.

Once the Spending Limit was enabled, the Debit Card screen should display the progress bar for this week spending.

From Debit Card screen, user could turn off the **Weekly spending limit** by tapping on the row with same label.

If user wish to enable the **Weekly spending limit** again, user could tap on **Weekly spending limit** row at Debit Card screen, the app should navigate to the Spending Limit screen with the amount pre-filled with previous submitted value.
